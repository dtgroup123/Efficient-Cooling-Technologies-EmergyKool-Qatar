A cooling tower is a device used to reduce the temperature of water. The water is then recycled back into the many processes and industries that use it. Some industries use the water to control the temperature (sensible heat), of a process, like a car radiator. The HVAC industry uses the water to condense the refrigerant (latent heat). In the past most of the processes requiring cooling use piped town water through the equipment, cooling the equipment, and then drained the water to the gutter (100% waste). Because Australia is such a dry continent the water supply authorities introduced the Water Conservation Act, which forced all the industries to install cooling towers to recycle the water.
